# CSCE A201 Project MUSIC MACHINE

This Project is a Music Machine with the purpose of playing music through two main methods: taking input from key presses to make beep noises, and reading a provided text file like sheet music. Each segment is stored in a different file.
The two parts are as follows:

# Synth
   Synth can be run by entering the synth folder and opening V1 synth.cpp, then hitting run. Use a s d f g h j k l ; ' for whole notes or the white notes on a piano. Use z to go down and octive and x to go up and octive. Use w e  t y u  o p for the half steps or the black notes on a piano. Use q to quit the program.

# FileReader
  FileReader can be run by entering the FileReader folder and opening "main.cpp", "TextPlayer.cpp", and "Textplayer.h". Running the file will print an interactive interface that will display a tutorial on how to make .txt files to be read by the program and information on which premade files exist in the folder, but entering the name of one of .txt files provided in the FileReader folder will play a pre-made song. 
-The premade .txt files include 'Full Scale.txt', 'HappyBirthday.txt', 'MaryLamb.txt', 'OdeToJoy.txt', 'Twinkle.txt'.
