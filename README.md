# CSCE A201 Project MUSIC MACHINE

This Project is a Music Machine with the purpose of playing music through two main methods: taking input from key presses to make beep noises, and reading a provided text file like sheet music. Each segment is stored in a different file.
The two parts are as follows:

# Synth
   Synth can be run by entering the synth folder and opening V1 synth.cpp, then hitting run. (insert extra instructions here)

# FileReader
  FileReader can be run by entering the FileReader folder and opening "main.cpp", "TextPlayer.cpp", and "Textplayer.h". Running the file will print an interactive interface that will display a tutorial on how to make .txt files to be read by the program, but entering the name of one of .txt files provided in the FileReader folder will play a pre-made song.
